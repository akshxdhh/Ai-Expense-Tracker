## 🚀 Getting Started

*Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.*
```bash
1. Prerequisites
   Git: To download the source code. (Download Git)
   Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 11 or higher. (Download OpenJDK)
   Apache Maven: To build the project. (Download Maven)
 ``` 

## How to Set Up and Run

*You can run this project either directly from an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or from your computer's command line.*

# Option 1: Running from an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA)

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/akshxdhh/Ai-Expense-Tracker.git](https://github.com/akshxdhh/Ai-Expense-Tracker.git)
```
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA:
      • Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
      • Select File > Open....
      • Navigate to the cloned project folder and select the pom.xml file.
      • Choose "Open as Project".

3. Load Maven Dependencies:
      • IntelliJ will automatically read the `pom.xml` file.
      • If prompted, click "Load Maven Changes" or open the Maven tool window on the right and click the "Reload All Maven Projects" button. This will download the necessary SQLite-JDBC driver.

4. Run the Application:
      • Navigate to the src/main/java/com/expensetracker folder.
      • Right-click on the ExpenseTrackerApp.java file and select "Run `ExpenseTrackerApp.main()`".

# Option 2: Running from the Command Line

**Prerequisites**
*Before you begin, you must have the following software installed and configured in your system's PATH.*
      • Git: To download the source code. ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
      • Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 11 or higher. ([Download OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/))
      • Apache Maven: To build the project. ([Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))

**Steps**

1. Clone the Repository:
*Open your command prompt, navigate to a directory of your choice, and run:*
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/akshxdhh/Ai-Expense-Tracker.git](https://github.com/akshxdhh/Ai-Expense-Tracker.git)
```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd Ai-Expense-Tracker
```

3. Build the Project:
*Use Maven to compile the code and package it into a runnable*.jar *file.*
```bash
mvn clean package
```
You will see a `BUILD SUCCESS` message when it's done. The output file will be located in the `target/` directory.

5. Run the Application:
*Execute the packaged* `.jar` *file using the* `java` *command.*
```bash
java -jar target/ai-expense-tracker-1.0.0.jar
```

The application window should now appear. The `expensetracker.db` file will be created in the project folder as you add your first expense.

> [!WARNING]
>If you modify the code to change the database structure (e.g., add a new field to `Expense.java`), you must delete the existing `expensetracker.db` file. The application will generate a new, correct database file on the next run.
